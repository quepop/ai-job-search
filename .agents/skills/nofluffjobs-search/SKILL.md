# No Fluff Jobs Search Skill

Search live job listings from **[nofluffjobs.com](https://nofluffjobs.com)** — the
Polish IT board built around **mandatory salary disclosure**. No authentication,
no API key, and **zero runtime dependencies** — it runs with just `bun`.

Its structural advantage over every other portal here: each posting states its
**required languages and levels** ("Polish (Fluent)", "English (C1)") as explicit
requirement entries rather than burying them in prose, so a language requirement
is a parsed field instead of something to infer from a description.

## ⚠️ Personal use only

This reads No Fluff Jobs' public, robots-permitted listing pages. **Keep volume
low, and don't use it commercially or for bulk data collection.** Run it on your
own responsibility.

`robots.txt` disallows **`/api/`** and **`/posting/`**, so this CLI never calls
the portal's JSON API. It reads the server-rendered `/pl` (search) and
`/job/<slug>` (detail) pages, which carry no `Disallow` rule.

## When to use this skill

- Search Polish IT openings by keyword, city (or remote), category and seniority
- Compare **B2B hourly, daily and monthly rates** across offers without opening any of them
- Read one posting's requirements, responsibilities, language levels and deadline
- Check whether a role's required languages match your own before investing time

## Commands

### Search job listings

```bash
bun run .agents/skills/nofluffjobs-search/cli/src/cli.ts search [flags]
```

Key flags:
- `--query <text>` / `-q <text>` — keywords (title, skill, technology). Recommended.
- `--location <place>` / `-l <place>` — a city or `Remote`. Accepts Polish diacritics and the Polish synonyms `zdalnie` / `praca zdalna`.
- `--category <slug>` / `-c <slug>` — `backend`, `frontend`, `fullstack`, `devops`, `testing`, `data`, `mobile`, …
- `--seniority <level>` — `trainee` | `junior` | `mid` | `senior` | `expert`
- `--page <n>` — 1-indexed. **The portal accumulates**: page N returns offers 1..20N, de-duplicated (see Notes).
- `--dates` — fetch each result's publication date. Costs **one extra request per result**; requires `--limit ≤ 30`.
- `--jobage <days>` — posted within N days. Implies `--dates`, so the same cost and limit rule applies.
- `--limit <n>` / `-n <n>` — cap results. Applied **before** date enrichment, so it bounds requests, not just output.
- `--format json|table|plain` — default `json`.

### Fetch full job detail

```bash
bun run .agents/skills/nofluffjobs-search/cli/src/cli.ts detail <slug|url> [--format json|plain]
```

`slug` is the `id` from a `search` result. A full `https://nofluffjobs.com/job/<slug>`
URL works too. Returns the posting's requirements (including **language levels**),
responsibilities, offer description, publication date, application deadline,
employment type and every salary band it advertises.

## Usage examples

```bash
# PHP/Symfony roles across Poland
bun run .agents/skills/nofluffjobs-search/cli/src/cli.ts search -q "PHP Symfony" --format table

# Senior remote Symfony roles
bun run .agents/skills/nofluffjobs-search/cli/src/cli.ts search -q "symfony" -l Remote --seniority senior --format table

# Senior remote backend roles with publication dates
bun run .agents/skills/nofluffjobs-search/cli/src/cli.ts search -c backend -l Remote --seniority senior --limit 10 --dates --format table

# Payments roles in Warsaw, second page of results
bun run .agents/skills/nofluffjobs-search/cli/src/cli.ts search -q "payments" -l "Warszawa" --page 2 --format table

# Remote PHP roles posted in the last 14 days
bun run .agents/skills/nofluffjobs-search/cli/src/cli.ts search -q "php" -l Remote --jobage 14 --limit 20 --format json

# Full details for a specific offer
bun run .agents/skills/nofluffjobs-search/cli/src/cli.ts detail mid-senior-symfony-developer-legacy-modernization-fluent-english-polcode-remote --format plain
```

## Output formats

| Format | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| `json` | Default — programmatic use; the only format carrying tags, every salary band, and the detail sections |
| `table` | Quick human-readable scanning (title, company, location, posted, salary) |
| `plain` | Reading a single job's full detail (`detail` command) |

Search JSON is `{ "meta": { "count", "page" }, "results": [...] }`; each result
carries `id`, `title`, `company`, `location`, `date`, `url` (the portal-skill
contract) plus `salary`, `tags` and `extraLocations`. `detail` adds `salaryBands`,
`deadline`, `requirements`, `tasks`, `description`, `employmentType`, `street` and
`country`. Missing values are `null`, never omitted. All errors are written to
**stderr** as `{ "error": "...", "code": "..." }` and the process exits with code `1`.

## Notes

- **Listing cards carry no publication date.** `date` is `null` on a plain search —
  meaning "not fetched", never "old". `--dates` (and `--jobage`, which implies it)
  fills it in from each posting's detail page at **one request per result**, which
  is why both require `--limit ≤ 30`. Without that ceiling a 14-day filter over a
  broad query would quietly turn a polite read into a crawl.
- **Pagination accumulates.** `?page=N` returns pages 1..N in one response, and the
  portal repeats promoted offers across them, so results are de-duplicated by slug.
  `--page 2` therefore yields ~40 unique offers, not offers 21-40.
- **Salaries come in several shapes** and all are parsed: `900 – 1 100 PLN / day`,
  `80 – 130 PLN + VAT (B2B) per hour`, `18 000 PLN / mth`, and abbreviated foreign
  bands like `1.5M – 2.5M HUF / month`. `salary.type` is `b2b` or `permanent` when
  the posting states it. A posting advertising both a B2B and a permanent band
  exposes both in `salaryBands`.
- **Detail pages append a "similar offers" list** carrying other companies' salary
  widgets. Parsing is scoped to the posting's own region, so those never leak into
  the returned salary — worth re-checking first if salaries ever look wrong.
- **Language requirements are first-class.** `requirements` lists them explicitly,
  e.g. `- Polish (Fluent)` / `- English (C1)`, which is exactly what the Language
  Gate in `04-job-evaluation.md` needs.
- **Not every listing is in Poland.** Some foreign employers advertise here
  (HUF and USD bands show up); `location` reports the posting's own city.
- **Postings are bilingual** — Polish or English depending on the employer, both
  returned as decoded UTF-8.
- Parsing anchors are documented in `url-reference.md` — the file to update if No
  Fluff Jobs changes its markup.
